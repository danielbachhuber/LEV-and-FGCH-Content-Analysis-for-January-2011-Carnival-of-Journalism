The changing role of Universities for the information needs of a community: One of the Knight Commission‘s recommendations is to “Increase the role of higher education... as hubs of journalistic activity.” Another is to “integrate digital and media literacy as critical elements for education at all levels through collaboration among federal, state, and local education officials.”

Okay – great recommendations. But how do we actually make it happen? What does this look like? What University programs are doing it right? What can be improved and what would be your ideal scenario? Or is this recommendation wrong to begin with? No box here to write inside of.

FUTURE IDEAS

* Community members can connect their news organization accounts with Foursquare. When spot news breaks, the news organization has working intelligence on who on the ground to cover it.
* Build a profile of the community's knowledge and expertise. This could be as simple as seeing which articles they comment on, and how the community reacts to those comments. If someone is writing A+ comments regularly, and those comments are a few paragraphs long, invite them to write a guest entry.
