This is a repository of the work I'm doing for my Carnival of Journalism blog post for January 2011. David Cohn's prompt for the post is the following:

The changing role of Universities for the information needs of a community: One of the Knight Commission‘s recommendations is to “Increase the role of higher education... as hubs of journalistic activity.” Another is to “integrate digital and media literacy as critical elements for education at all levels through collaboration among federal, state, and local education officials.”

Okay – great recommendations. But how do we actually make it happen? What does this look like? What University programs are doing it right? What can be improved and what would be your ideal scenario? Or is this recommendation wrong to begin with? No box here to write inside of.

My goal is to approach this blog post in a "now and the future". The two case examples I have best access to are The Local Fort Greene-Clinton Hill, a blog run in partnership between CUNY and The New York Times, and The Local East Village, a blog run in partnership between NYU and The New York Times. I'd like to do a content and technology analysis for each, paint a strong picture of what's going on, and use this data to offer suggestions on what might be done in the future.
