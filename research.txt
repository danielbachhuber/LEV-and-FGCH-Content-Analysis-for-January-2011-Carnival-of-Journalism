QUESTIONS FOR THE EDITORS

LEV responses are from Rich Jones, the Editor. FGCH responses are from Annaliese Griffin, one of the Editors of the Fort Greene-Clinton Hill website.

How many people did you have on your staff in November 2010?
* LEV: "There were two staffers, myself and Kim Davis, the site’s community editor (a consultant who serves as a liaison with community contributors who author posts and shoot photos for the site). In addition, content for the site was provided by roughly 35 students in an elective class called 'The Hyperlocal Newsroom.'"
* FGCH: "Indrani and I are both half-time, which includes instruction time in the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism class that participates in The Local. So 2 part-timers."

What were the different ways story ideas were sourced?
* LEV: "Story ideas were sourced via 'pre-interviews' by the potential authors of the pieces as well as extensive reviews of any existing literature (i.e.-news stories, press releases, etc.) or official documentation."
* FGCH: "We have story meetings in class, and community members also write in with tips, ideas and pitches. And, we read news stories to stay abreast of current news. Then, there are meetings and press releases."

How often did you have editorial meetings in November 2010, and how long was the average story production cycle (from idea to publication)?
* LEV: "We held weekly story meetings during the Hyperlocal Newsroom class and kept in regular contact with our student and community contributors via e-mail. The average story production cycle varied: for a breaking news piece, it could have, literally, been a matter of minutes; for longer form feature stories it could have been days or weeks."
* FGCH: "Weekly story meetings in two different CUNY classes and the production cycle varied a lot. Some were breaking news, same-day turnarounds. Others were weeks in the making, like features or reader polls that then became flash pieces."

What tools does your editorial team use to keep in touch while they’re physically separate?
* LEV: "In order from most-used to least-used: E-mail, gchat, text message, cell phone."
* FGCH: "Gmail, gchat, google doc and the phone."

What percentage of total story ideas do you think were you able to cover?
* LEV: "Roughly 70 percent to 80 percent."
* FGCH: "Maybe, 75? There are always feels like there’s so much more we’re not covering, though."

What successes and challenges have you seen working with student reporters? Community contributors?
* LEV: "With both student reporters and community contributors we have been impressed with their talent and enthusiasm and receptiveness to editing. A challenge for students is working around their class schedules for story assignments and filing stories; a challenge regarding the community is helping them become accustomed to professional-level standards that some – through not fault of their own – are largely unfamiliar with."
* FGCH: "Scheduling is the big problem with students. They have to balance Local assignments with stories for three other classes. You can’t just say, “This event is happening today, you have to cover it.” It’s always a negotiation, which ties your hands as an editor. The successes have been many, though. Seeing students gain story sense and understand not only what needs to be covered, but how best to cover a community has been great. Also, we worked on several crowdsourcing projects that were fun and innovative. Here’s a post outlining my favorite student work from last semester: http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/the-day-favorite-stories-from-the-semester/ With community contributors we’ve found that straight news, especially crime and anything dealing with city agencies is a challenge. Reporting is hard work that takes skill that needs to be developed over years, not afternoons. We’ve gotten great features and opinion pieces from community contributors, and our schools coverage is about half reported by students, half community contributors and concerned parents. It’s a nice mix."

What type of stories are most likely going to be picked up by community contributors? What's the most difficult for them to cover?
* LEV: "Feature stories are most likely to be picked up by contributors. The most difficult stories appear to be hard news pieces (fires, crime, etc.) which involve multiple sources and contacting the authorities such as police and fire officials."
* FGCH: "See above, but crime is very hard. Schools, arts, and local goings on are very fruitful. People in the community can tell you, and share with each other via the blog, the sort of micro concerns that are hard to report. Like, cracked sidewalks, trash pick up, noise complaints, great art programs in schools. These are things that people talk about over the dinner table and while sweeping their stoops and we want them on The Local."

What were the most important stories of November 2010?
* LEV: "There’s a difference between the most important and the most widely read. The most important story was likely the site’s continuing (coverage)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/stabbing-victims-sister-mourns-loss/] of the fatal stabbing of a 21-year-old man. The most widely read story was a piece about the proliferation of (craft beer)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/in-the-east-village-a-craft-beer-hub/] in the East Village."
* FGCH: "This story about a local bar closing was huge: http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/moes-to-close-after-standstill-negotiations/ This subway survey was really fun and we got tons of response: http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/subway-survey-results/ This community safety meeting was big: http://fort-greene.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/fga-calls-for-more-beat-cops-school-funding/ especially because of a local uptick in crime."

What do you think are the most important topics/stories affecting your community now?
* LEV: "Stories involving quality of life issues, such as (crime)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/the-day-shooting-adds-to-a-trying-week/], (transportation)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/a-cue-from-tourists-on-public-space/], (noise)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/two-refused-by-liquor-license-panel/] and (development)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/height-limits-on-buildings-approved/]."
FGCH: "Crime is still important, there was a drive-by shooting that hit five teens last week. Real estate and development are huge. And schools. Kindergarten application season is upon us and school talk is everywhere."

Are there any questions you think I missed?
* LEV: "No, but let me know if I can answer any others."
* FGCH: "I think it’s important to understand the news landscape in a given area, whether geographic or niche. We compete with a couple of blogs, like Brownstoner and MyLittleO for news, as well as Fort Greene Patch, which just started up. The Brooklyn Paper and City Room are also outlets that cover Fort Greene and Clinton Hill extensively."

Is there any specific type of content analysis you’d like me to do on your website?
* LEV: "No, but I’m happy to listen to any ideas."
