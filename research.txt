QUESTIONS FOR THE EDITORS

LEV responses are from Rich Jones, the Editor.

How many people did you have on your staff in November 2010?
* LEV: "There were two staffers, myself and Kim Davis, the site’s community editor (a consultant who serves as a liaison with community contributors who author posts and shoot photos for the site). In addition, content for the site was provided by roughly 35 students in an elective class called 'The Hyperlocal Newsroom.'"

What were the different ways story ideas were sourced?
* LEV: "Story ideas were sourced via 'pre-interviews' by the potential authors of the pieces as well as extensive reviews of any existing literature (i.e.-news stories, press releases, etc.) or official documentation."

How often did you have editorial meetings in November 2010, and how long was the average story production cycle (from idea to publication)?
* LEV: "We held weekly story meetings during the Hyperlocal Newsroom class and kept in regular contact with our student and community contributors via e-mail. The average story production cycle varied: for a breaking news piece, it could have, literally, been a matter of minutes; for longer form feature stories it could have been days or weeks."

What tools does your editorial team use to keep in touch while they’re physically separate?
* LEV: "In order from most-used to least-used: E-mail, gchat, text message, cell phone."

What percentage of total story ideas do you think were you able to cover?
* LEV: "Roughly 70 percent to 80 percent."

What successes and challenges have you seen working with student reporters? Community contributors?
* LEV: "With both student reporters and community contributors we have been impressed with their talent and enthusiasm and receptiveness to editing. A challenge for students is working around their class schedules for story assignments and filing stories; a challenge regarding the community is helping them become accustomed to professional-level standards that some – through not fault of their own – are largely unfamiliar with."

What type of stories are most likely going to be picked up by community contributors? What's the most difficult for them to cover?
* LEV: "Feature stories are most likely to be picked up by contributors. The most difficult stories appear to be hard news pieces (fires, crime, etc.) which involve multiple sources and contacting the authorities such as police and fire officials."

What were the most important stories of November 2010?
* LEV: "There’s a difference between the most important and the most widely read. The most important story was likely the site’s continuing (coverage)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/stabbing-victims-sister-mourns-loss/] of the fatal stabbing of a 21-year-old man. The most widely read story was a piece about the proliferation of (craft beer)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/in-the-east-village-a-craft-beer-hub/] in the East Village."

What do you think are the most important topics/stories affecting your community now?
* LEV: "Stories involving quality of life issues, such as (crime)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/the-day-shooting-adds-to-a-trying-week/], (transportation)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/a-cue-from-tourists-on-public-space/], (noise)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/two-refused-by-liquor-license-panel/] and (development)[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/height-limits-on-buildings-approved/]."

Are there any questions you think I missed?
* LEV: "No, but let me know if I can answer any others."

Is there any specific type of content analysis you’d like me to do on your website?
* LEV: "No, but I’m happy to listen to any ideas."
